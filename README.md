# bamazon
An Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

(gif coming soon...)

### How to Run
This app is employed using a localhost MySQL server and node in the terminal. Make sure you are connecting to localhost:3307. Start server, download all files, open in terminal and type any of the following commands to run:
`node bamazonCustomer.js`
